# `yabai`

This is an okay replacement for [`i3wm`](https://i3wm.org/) on mac. It requires
a few pieces to work, however:

* [`yabai`](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai)
* [`skhd`](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd)
* [`JankyBorders`](https://github.com/FelixKratz/JankyBorders)

`JankyBorders` might be an acceptable replacement for `limelight` to highlight
the focused window. Requires Sonoma so can't test it yet.
