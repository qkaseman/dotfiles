# Misc

Miscelaneous things that don't fall into a specific category or that don't have
enough related things to warrant their own `todo` file.

## Repo Hooks

Formatting hooks in this repo. Or maybe just hooks inside `nvim` that are a
general global? But then it would need to be lines I touch to not screw things
up, so repo-specific prob better.

## `fzf` command line completion

Should work but doesn't seem to? At least not with `fzf-tab`.
