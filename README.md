# Configurations

Yeah, that's really it. I'm sure I'll have more to add later.

## Git

The core git configurations are within the `git` directory here. However, as the name and email might change (for example, when using work email) so that information should be added to `~/.gitconfig` as:

```
[user]
    email = <email>
    name = <username>
```
